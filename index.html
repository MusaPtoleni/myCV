          <h2>My Bio</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am an ethical and hard-working Full-Stack developer student
            currently at HyperionDev and soon to be a Programmer
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Prior in becoming a HyperionDev student I was working for a courier
            company knowing my sole purpose was to raise funds so that i can
            pursue my dreams of becoming a Programmer
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Growing up I've always been obsessed about new how laptop and phones
            and how they operate to the point where I would open up a phone of
            laptop just to see whats inside and how it operates, Now im able to
            fix some software and hardware issues on them due to Youtube
            tutorials and with me leaning be a Programmer will further make me
            understand how these two devices works.

          <p>
            My previous job as a courier helped me a lot to understand more
            about our clients and the desire of the company. I worked a lot with
            our clients to make sure that their happy with our services and our
            company.I worded there for 2 years, Customer services plays a big
            part of any company and having to develope that skill improved me as
            an employee.
